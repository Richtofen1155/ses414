v1.0 to v1.1:
Added bondage gear
  - Implemented special apparel type which applies a HeDiff when it's equipped
  - Implemented locked apparel system which makes certain apparel unremovable except with a special "holokey" item
  - Implemented new ThingComp which attaches a unique hex ID & engraved name to items

  - Finally with all the infrastructure done, added the actual bondage gear

  - Added surgery recipes to remove gear without the key at the cost of permanent damage to the bound pawn
  - Added recipes to produce the gear (and an intermediate product, the hololock)
Started using the Harmony library to patch methods
  - No longer need to override the Lovin' JobDef thanks to patches in JobDriver_Lovin.MakeNewToils and JobDriver.Cleanup. This should
    increase compatibility with other mods and hopefully will work smoothly and not blow up in my face.
  - Patched a bunch of methods to enable bondage gear
  - Created a custom build of Harmony because the regular one wasn't able to find libmono.so on my Linux system
Pawns (except w/ Bloodlust or Psychopath) are less likely to hit a prisoner they're raping if the prisoner is already in significant pain
Nymphs won't join-in-bed colonists who are in significant pain
STD balance changes
  - Infections won't pass between pawns unless the severity is at least 21%
  - Accelerated course of warts by 50% and syphilis by ~20%
  - Reworked env pitch chances: base chance is lower and room cleanliness now has a much greater impact
  - Herpes is 33% more likely to appear on newly generated pawns
  - Pawns cannot be infected if they have any lingering immunity
  - Syphilis starts at 20% severity (but it isn't more dangerous since the other stats have been adjusted to compensate)
  - Syphilis can be cured if its severity is pushed below 1% even without immunity
STD defs are loaded from XML instead of hardcoded
Added some config options related to STDs
Sex need won't decline on pawns under age 15
Renamed "age_of_consent" to "sex_free_for_all_age" and reduced value from 20 to 19
Prisoners under the FFA age cannot be designated for rape

v0.9 to v1.0:
Reduced the chance of food poisoning from rimming from 5% to 0.75%
Added age_of_consent, max_nymph_fraction, and opp_inf_initial_immunity to XML config
Pawns whose genitals have been removed or destroyed can now still be raped
The "Raped" debuff now stacks
Fixed incompatibilities with Prepare Carefully
  - Mod no longer prevents the PC menu from opening
  - Reworked bootstrap code so the privates will be re-added after PC removed them (this won't happen in the PC menu, though, only
    once the pawns appear on the map)
  - Fixed a crash that occured when PC tried to generate tooltips for bionic privates
Fixed derp-tier programming that boosted severity instead of immunity on opportunistic infections
Sex satisfaction now depends on the average of the two pawn's abilities instead of their product
Flesh coverage stats for the torso are now correctly set when the genitals part is inserted
Fixed warts and syphilis not being curable and rebalanced them a bit
Sex need now decreases faster when it's high and slower when it's low
Nymphs now won't fuck pawns outside their allowed area
Fixed "allowed me to get raped" thought appearing on masochists
Nymph join event baseChance reduced from 1.0 to 0.67 and minRefireDays increased from 2 to 6
