1. Rimjobworld is compatible with existing saves. However be aware that the private parts won't appear immediately on your pawns, you have to unpause the game and let the injection code trigger (which won't take more than a few seconds).

2. Newer versions should work in place of older ones without breaking save games. If you load a save created with v0.9 with a newer version you'll probably get an error message about a missing MapComponent, this is safe to ignore.

3. Through the magic of def injection, RJW integrates automatically with EPOE. That means, if you have EPOE installed, the recipes to craft the artificial private parts will appear in the EPOE benches, otherwise they'll appear in the regular places (machining bench & crafting spot).

4. When using Prepare Carefully, the private parts won't appear in the PC menu, but they will appear once the pawns reach the map. You can use PC to set specific privates for your colonists using the implant menu.

5. RJW should be loaded after Children & Pregnancy mod for the lovin job patches to work properly.
