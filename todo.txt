DONE:
Sex need
  - Ticks down over time and gets replenished by lovin'
  - Moodlets applied depending on need level
Sex stat
  - Affects satisfaction from sex; prevents sex/fap at 0%
Nymphomaniac trait
  - Nymphos need more sex & enjoy sex more
  - Nymphos fuck sleeping colonists if they are horny or have nothing else to do
Nymph joiners
  - Fixed gender, age, body type, and traits
Masturbation
  - Code "fappin" which is like lovin' without a partner
  - Insert into ThinkTree so pawns can fap on their own
Private Parts
  - Human body has a "genitals" part that automatically includes a penis or vagina as appropriate
  - Dick/vag can be amputated; severed dicks/vags can be reattached
  - Can craft bionic dick & vag, peg dick, hydraulic vagina. Integrates with EPOE if present.
STDs
  - HIV: Affects whole body; progresses slowly but is incurable; decreases blood filtration
    - With blood fil. < 40%, pawns develop immunodeficiency which causes sickness debuffs and random infections (simulating AIDS)
  - Warts: Affects only genitals; curable and not fatal; causes genitals to become itchy, painful, and unsightly
  - Syphilis: Affects whole body; easily cured with treament but usually fatal without; causes bad mood, reduces con & manip, major infections
    can cause permanent damage to brain, liver, kidneys
  - Herpes: Like warts except milder and incurable
Rape
  - Designate prisoners as "comfort prisoners" and colonists will rape them to satisfy sex need or just for fun
  - Comfort prisoners get huge mood & relations debuffs, making them harder to control or recruit
  - Colonists beat prisoners during rape, especially if they have bloodlust or brawler
  - Colonists with bloodlust love to rape; masochists actually enjoy being raped
Bondage Gear
  - Chastity Belt prevents sex, armbinder prevents manipulation & fighting, and gag prevents talking & impedes eating
  - Gear becomes locked onto a pawn once it's equipped and cannot be removed by normal means (e.g. by ordering the pawn to drop it)
  - When gear is equipped, it spawns a "holokey," which can be used to unlock and remove the gear. The specific piece of bondage gear and its
    key are linked by matching "holostamps" so not just any key will work.
  - Bondage gear and holokeys can be used on prisoners by selecting a warden and right-clicking the items
  - Gear can be surgically removed without the key but this causes serious burns and destroyed body parts

TO DO:
Add new body part groups for the bondage gear (specifically a genitals group for the CB and a jaw or mouth group for the gag, the mouth group that's already in the game won't work I'm pretty sure)
Once that (^^^) is done make it so that the groups are automatically blocked by the gear, like a more robust version of the blocks_genitals flag
Add more thoughts after sex about e.g. partner's dick size and sex skill
Move more constants into the XML config file
Look into how beds are reserved during fappin and especially nymph join-in-bed. I think right now the bed just isn't reserved.
Finish descriptions for nymph backstories
Rape
  - Add comfort prisoner rapin as a proper joy activity. Currently colonists only rape for fun when they have no work to do.
Orgies
  - Like parties except everyone gets naked and fucks
Nymph visitors
  - Don't join, just stay on the map a while to fuck your colonists, eat your food, and do your drugs
  - Should be able to deconstruct walls or mine through mountains to get at drugs, just to troll players
Add chance for sex/fap with a peg dick to produce splinters
Casual sex
  - Random social interaction causes two single pawns who are attracted to one another to drop what they're doing, find a bed, and fuck

TO DO EVENTUALLY (AKA NEVER):
Make the text translateable instead of hardcoded English
Improve detection of genital harvest vs amputation
  - (Maybe) Make it so that downgrading a pawn is considered harvesting

OTHER RANDOM/HALF-BAKED IDEAS:
Strap prisoners to their beds
Consumable aphrodisiacs
Necrophilia
Sex addiction
  - Reduces satisfaction from sex
  - Should only affect nymphomaniacs?
Succubuses (or succubi if you prefer)
  - What would they do?
